## ‚úèÔ∏è Customizing `VJ_PIPELINE.json`

You can modify `VJ_PIPELINE.json` to reflect your local paths and preferences. Here's what each key does:

```json
{
  "hpath": "$VJ_PIPELINE",
  "env": [
    { "VJ_PIPELINE": "<path-to-your-VJ_PIPELINE-folder>" },
    { "HOUDINI_PATH": "$VJ_PIPELINE" },
    { "RND": "<path-to-your-RND-folder>" },
    { "HOUDINI_SPLASH_MESSAGE": "Version: ${HOUDINI_VERSION} \n YOUR NAME HERE" },
    { "HOUDINI_SPLASH_FILE": "$VJ_PIPELINE/splash/YOUR_SPLASH_IMAGE.jpg" },
    { "TEX_SO": "<path-to-sourceimages-folder>" },
    { "CACHE_SO": "<path-to-cache-folder>" },
    { "RENDER_SO": "<path-to-render-folder>" },
    { "SHOTS_SO": "<path-to-shots-folder>" },
    { "RND_SO": "<path-to-local-houdini-rnd-folder>" }
  ]

```

## üìù Customizing `Editor.json`

This file lets you define which text/code editor to launch from within Houdini.

Example:

```json
{
  "env" : [
    {
      "EDITOR" : "C:/Users/ADMIN/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/Code.exe"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can change the path of `EDITOR` to match your preferred editor's executable path. For example:

- **VS Code (default):**
  ```json
  "EDITOR": "C:/Path/To/VSCode/Code.exe"
  ```
- **Sublime Text:**
  ```json
  "EDITOR": "C:/Program Files/Sublime Text/sublime_text.exe"
  ```

Make sure the path is correct and accessible on your machine.
